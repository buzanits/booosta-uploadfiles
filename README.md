# Multiple file upload in HTML form for Booosta PHP Framework

This modules provides a file upload for multiple files in HTML forms for the Booosta Framework.

Booosta allows to develop PHP web applications quick. It is mainly designed for small web applications.
It does not provide a strict MVC distinction. Although the MVC concepts influence the framework. Templates,
data objects can be seen as the Vs and Ms of MVC.

Up to version 3 Booosta was available at Sourceforge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/booosta/ From version
4 on it resides on Github and is available from Packagist under booosta/booosta .

This is an early development version which cannot be used yet. Get Booosta 3 from Sourceforge or wait for
a usable version. Sorry, there will be no (easy) upgrade path from Booosta 3 to Booosta 4.
